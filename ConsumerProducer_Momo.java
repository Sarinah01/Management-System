Explanation:

1. The SharedResource class represents a resource that is shared between the producer and consumer threads. It has a value variable that holds the produced value and a isValueSet flag to indicate whether the value has been set or consumed.
2. The produce() method is called by the producer thread. It uses a while loop to check if the isValueSet flag is true, indicating that the value has already been produced. If so, it waits by calling wait(). Once it can proceed, it sets the value, prints the produced value, sets isValueSet to true, and notifies the waiting threads using notify().
3. The consume() method is called by the consumer thread. It uses a while loop to check if the isValueSet flag is false, indicating that the value has not yet been produced. If so, it waits by calling wait(). Once it can proceed, it consumes the value, prints the consumed value, sets isValueSet to false, and notifies the waiting threads using notify().
4. The Producer and Consumer classes extend Thread and override the run() method. In the run() method, they call the produce() and consume() methods, respectively, in a loop for a certain number of iterations.
5. The Main class creates an instance of SharedResource and the producer and consumer threads. It starts the threads, which run concurrently and perform the producer-consumer operations.

When you run this program, you should see the producer producing values and the consumer consuming them alternately. The `wait*/
